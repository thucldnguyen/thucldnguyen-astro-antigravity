## Article: Designing an AI-First PM Workflow in a Real Enterprise

Published: January 31, 2026

At Axon's Company Kickoff week in January 2026, we ran multiple AI events back-to-back. Two of which fundamentally changed how I think about AI.

The first was Axon Tech Summit, where I had the chance to MC a AMA panel with Axon leaders including Jeff Kunins (CPO/CTO), Mark VanAntwerp (SVP of Engineering) and other senior engineering/AI leaders. The theme was: AI in everything we build, build everything with AI, the risk of adopting AI vs. the risk of not adopting it.

The second was an internal AI Hackathon, where I was exposed — for the first time — to the idea of a fleet of AI agents and tools like Claude Code operating directly on real codebases.

What struck me wasn't just the technology. It was the energy. People weren't excited about prompts or chatbots. They were excited about velocity — about removing entire categories of work that slow teams down.

That week became the catalyst for my latest exploration of AI — not as a novelty, but as a way to fundamentally redesign how I work as a product manager.

### AI-assisted vs. AI-first

Product managers often use "AI-assisted" and "AI-first" interchangeably. They are not the same thing.

- AI-assisted means AI helps you do the same work a bit faster.
- AI-first means you redesign the system so the work often doesn't need to be done by a human at all.

This post is about the second approach.

What follows is a concrete, end-to-end AI-first PM workflow I use in a real enterprise environment — across bug triage, product discovery, prototyping, and delivery. It includes what worked, what failed, and where human judgment still cannot be replaced.

### 1. Bug triage as an autonomous agent

Bug triage is necessary — and brutally expensive in cognitive load.

I built a bug-triage agent using Glean that: queries customer-reported tickets in JIRA, performs enterprise search across Quip, SharePoint, Jira, and Slack, retrieves relevant known issues, similar past bugs, and troubleshooting steps, proposes the next best action: request reproducible steps, ask for artifacts (HAR, audit trails), provide a useful advice to support engineers, route to the correct team.

Instead of reacting to every ticket, I now review decisions. The agent does the digging. I apply my judgment. That's what AI-first looks like in practice.

### 2. Product discovery with AI as a research accelerator

There is still no substitute for direct customer interaction. I believe that deeply.

What AI has changed is how well-prepared I am before those conversations.

I use GPT-5.2 Pro in "deep research" mode to: simulate interviews with domain experts, crawl Reddit for real-world incidents and public reactions, propose top 5 features then have GPT-5.2 Pro debate 20 times with itself to ruthlessly prioritize them, retrieve historical VOC from internal knowledge bases, sanity-check specs and architectures using Glean.

The result isn't AI-designed products. It's better hypotheses, sharper questions, and higher-quality conversations with real customers.

### 3. Prototyping that engineers actually take seriously

AI has radically compressed my path from idea to something runnable.

My flow: rapid throwaway prototypes using Figma Make, export HTML/CSS/JS from Figma Make to a local git repository, refine the prototype via Claude Code CLI in Cursor, Visual Studio Code with Copilot, and Antigravity with Gemini 3 Pro, integrate the prototype directly into axon-ui using Axon's official UI components and design tokens, run a local dev server hosting the above code against a real Evidence.com instance with real video evidence.

Engineers don't get a figma fantasy. They get working code in a GitHub branch they can explore. That changes the conversation.

Key takeaway: Vibe coding only works when you can describe systems succinctly. If you can't explain it, AI can't build it.

### 4. Delivery: using AI to navigate legacy complexity

Legacy codebases are where productivity goes to die.

I regularly use Claude to: explain legacy code left undocumented by the previous owners, trace legacy UI flows to understand how the app works, fix low-hanging UI bugs safely.

This doesn't replace engineers. It lets me meet them closer to their level, faster.

### When AI failed me (and why that mattered)

AI is not magic. I learned this the hard way.

I once asked Claude to re-implement an entire vibe-coded prototype as a new page inside axon-ui. It failed spectacularly.

The app crashed on load. After 2 days of debugging with no success, I reverted everything and started over — this time: creating a new page from scratch, adding axon-ui components incrementally, fixing console errors one by one, validating each step locally before pushing to GitHub Enterprise.

The lesson was clear: AI doesn't have enough context to safely modify systems with millions of code lines and thousands of dependencies. Vibe coding only works when you understand the architecture well enough to guide it. Speed without architectural understanding turns into fragility.

### What being AI-first actually means for PMs

Most PMs don't struggle with AI because they lack tools. They struggle because they think it's "just a chatbot".

AI should aggressively eliminate: repetitive procedural work, data synthesis and retrieval, tasks that consume senior attention without requiring senior judgment.

AI should not replace: customer conversations, judgment calls, ambiguous decision-making. Those remain human.

The biggest risk for PMs isn't "AI taking your job." It's having a role that cannot be meaningfully AI-accelerated.

Being AI-first doesn't mean 'chat with GPT more'. It means constantly asking: Should a human still be doing this? If not, how do I make this disappear permanently?

I don't want AI replacing my judgment. I want AI protecting it. That's the real advantage.

AI doesn't replace product thinking — it amplifies it. And in complex systems, reclaimed time — applied with judgment — is everything.

## Article: The Great Unshackling: How the Product Craft Evolves in the Age of AI

Published: November 10, 2025

Tags: Product Management, AI, Future of Work, Leadership

Julie Zhuo wrote something recently that really stuck with me: "The Thing You Are Expert at Will Be Your Career Downfall".

In it, she reminds us that mastery doesn't vanish when technology evolves — it transforms. When photography emerged in 1839, French academic painter Paul Delaroche reportedly declared, "From today, painting is dead!" In one sense, Delaroche was right — what died was the careers of those painters who photocopied what they saw. But in the broader sense, Delaroche was dead wrong. Photography unshackled painting from its utilitarian purpose.

### The Utilitarian Side of Product Work

For years, our craft has been very hands-on: writing specs, triaging bugs, organizing backlogs, managing standups, ensuring cross-functional alignment. Much of it is busywork disguised as craftsmanship. It's about documentation, coordination, and process discipline — all of which are necessary, but not sacred.

This is the part of product management that AI should automate, and fast: Spec writing, Backlog triage, Meeting summaries and updates, Data analysis.

Just as photography freed painters from painting portraits for the rich, AI is freeing product managers from this layer of administrative labor. We're being unshackled from our utilitarian past.

### The Great Unshackling

When we hand over the utilitarian layer to AI, we're not losing our identity — we're reclaiming our purpose. We can spend less time maintaining Jira hygiene and more time understanding what keeps customers up at night.

AI won't replace product managers; it'll remove the mechanical shell around the craft, leaving behind the part that's most human — empathy, storytelling, and judgment.

### Rediscovering the Human Side

Certain responsibilities still demand distinctly human judgment and taste: Defining the vision, Building roadmaps, Talking to customers (nobody wants to give feedback to a chatbot — they want to be heard by another human being who can empathize), Building trust and alignment.

Empathy is what transforms a set of requirements into a real solution. These are the areas where product managers must double down.

### A Personal Example: When Empathy Meets Product Judgment

In my world of digital evidence management, empathy isn't just a nice-to-have — it's mission-critical. Cops don't watch video evidence for entertainment. They watch it to investigate crimes, to uncover truth, and ultimately to put the bad guys in jail faster.

If we blindly borrowed YouTube's playbook (social features, easy editing, trending algorithms), we'd build features that are useless or dangerous in law enforcement. Instead, what officers need is help finding the critical few seconds in hours of footage.

That's the kind of problem I'm working on — using AI to surface truth faster, while keeping the integrity of evidence intact.
