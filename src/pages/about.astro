	<p>You've found me! Welcome to my personal blog.</p>

	<p>
		My name is <strong>Thuc Nguyen</strong> - a Senior Product Manager at <a
			href="https://www.axon.com">Axon</a
		>, husband and proud dad of two: Mira is 2 years young and Mino is brand
		new. Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet!
	</p>

	<h2>Early Spark</h2>

	<p>
		I grew up in Vietnam, a country still rebuilding after war where most
		kids had never even seen a computer, let alone owned one. My dad was a
		tradditional medicine practitioner who had to retire early due to his
		eyesight. My mom, a nurse with an iron will and a soft heart, kept our
		family afloat on her modest salary.
	</p>

	<p>
		Then in 6th grade, magic arrived: my mom’s friend gifted us her old <strong
			>Intel 80386</strong
		> computer. It felt like Christmas, Lunar New Year, and a lottery win all
		rolled into one. To put things in perspective, that machine cost roughly 3.6
		ounces of gold — enough to buy half a hectare (1.2 acres) of rice paddy back
		in the 1990s.
	</p>

	<p>
		But to me, it was priceless. It was my window into a new world of
		technology and wonders.
	</p>

	<p>
		I still remember fumbling with the QWERTY keyboard, typing DOS commands
		and watching the screen obey like it was alive. When my dad helped me
		install Windows 3.1, I discovered CorelDraw and fell in love with
		digital art. Before long, curiosity turned into obsession.
	</p>

	<p>
		That obsession earned me a spot in an honors class for competitive
		programming in middle-school. I was coding for hours everyday, learning
		discrete mathematics, sorting algorithms, recursion, tree traversal,
		graph theory and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
		Although I loved solving academic problems like finding the shortest
		path using Dijkstra's algorithm, I was more drawn to moving pixels on
		the screen. My "wow" moment came when I built a <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi"
			>Tower of Hanoi</a
		> game with a graphical UI on MS DOS using Pascal. It wasn't pretty but it
		worked and that was enough to make me feel like a wizard, realizing I could
		create something interesting out of thin air with just if-else statements,
		for loops, and a flicker of imagination.
	</p>

	<p>
		I competed in numerous contests — sometimes winning, sometimes losing,
		but always learning. My proudest (and most nerve-wracking) moment came
		in 9th grade when I won first prize in a city-wide programming contest
		in Ho Chi Minh City — a city of over ten million people and hundreds of
		thousdands of kids my age.
	</p>

	<p>
		What no one knew was that I almost blew it. I forgot to hit save halfway
		through, my floppy disk failed repeatedly, and I had to rewrite my code
		under brutal time pressure. I submitted my work not even sure if it was
		saved correctly. When the results came weeks later, I was stunned: I’d
		actually won a gold medal. It was the sweetest victory of my life.
	</p>

	/>

	<p>
		Programming wasn’t just a hobby — it was a lifeline. I knew it could
		pull my family out of poverty and open doors to a better future. My
		parents, especially my mom, encouraged me every step of the way. From
		her, I learned grit, empathy, and the joy of lifelong learning. (She's
		64 now and still improving her French and English)
	</p>

	<p>
		I went on to study at <strong>Lê Hồng Phong</strong> — one of Vietnam's most
		prestigious high schools, also in an honors class specialized in programming.
		Graduating from high school, it was a no-brainer to pursue Computer Science
		in university. Thanks to my background in competitive programming, I graduated
		as valedictorian from <strong>Hoa Sen University</strong>.
	</p>

	<h2>Learning Product the Hard Way</h2>

	<p>
		By 2010s, I stepped into the professional world at a boutique Silicon
		Valley firm called <a href="https://www.logigear.com/">LogiGear</a>. My
		first role was Business Analyst which, at the time, basically meant
		“write product specs and hope they make sense.” I gradually climbed the
		ranks to Associate Product Manager, then Product Manager for a test
		automation platform called <a href="https://testarchitect.com/"
			>TestArchitect</a
		>. It was a scrappy, hands-on environment where I deepened my tech depth
		and learned the craft of product management from the ground up: asking
		the five whys, thinking critically, measuring success and structuring
		every decision with the 1:3:1 approach.
	</p>

	<p>
		We became one of Microsoft's first partners to release an automation
		extension for Visual Studio — TA4VS — which made .NET testing a breeze
		for non-technical testers. I spent nearly two years in the US
		(2016–2017), leading content marketing for the product and writing for
		testing communities like TechWell. My mentor, <a
			href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/do-hat-nguyen/">Do Nguyen</a
		>, taught me how to think strategically, build roadmaps, and tell
		stories that resonate. Those lessons shaped how I work to this day.
	</p>

	<p>
		LogiGear was also where I met my soulmate - Xuyen. We spent our
		honeymoon in Europe, right before COVID hit. Four weeks after we left
		Milan, Italy closed its borders and imposed its very first
		shelter-in-place quarantine. It was a close call and a great story.
	</p>

	<Image src={honeyMoonCollage} alt="Honey moon" title="Honey moon" />

	<h2>Building for Public Safety</h2>

	<p>
		After nearly a decade at LogiGear, I joined <a
			href="https://www.axon.com/">Axon</a
		>, the tech company best known for the <a
			href="https://www.axon.com/products/taser-10">TASER</a
		>. My first product was <a
			href="https://www.axon.com/en-vn/products/axon-performance"
			>Axon Performance</a
		>, a tool that helps police agencies track and improve how officers use
		their TASER weapons, body cameras and in-car cameras through AI-powered
		video audits. When I joined, Axon Performance had around 11,000 adopted
		users. Two years later, we crossed 110,000 — a 10X growth.
	</p>

	<p>
		More importantly, Performance gave command staff visibility into
		operations they'd never had before. We launched multiple product
		initiatives that customers loved like the <strong
			>TASER Dashboard</strong
		>, <strong>Fleet3 Dashboard</strong>, <strong
			>Weekly Compliance Report</strong
		>, and <strong>Priority-Ranked Video Audits</strong> all designed to help
		agencies ensure accountability and policy compliance. Today, over 1,500 police
		departments rely on Axon Performance to make data-driven decisions that ultimately
		lead to safer outcomes for both officers and communities.
	</p>

	<Image
		src={axonPerfPng}
		alt="Axon Performance - TASER dashboard"
		title="Axon Performance - TASER dashboard"
	/>

	<p>
		Now I lead product for one of Axon’s bread-and-butter features: <strong
			>video streaming and evidence playback</strong
		> on Evidence.com. It’s where officers and investigators review digital evidence
		every day. We’ve cut streaming latency in half, reduced rebuffering, and completely
		revamped the review workflow. It’s not just a feature — it’s the beating heart
		of our platform. With around 550,000 monthly active users, it’s humbling to
		think that more than half of all officers in the US interact with something
		my team built.
	</p>

	<p>
		Working with law enforcement has given me a unique perspective. During
		ride-alongs with departments like San Jose PD, Tucson PD, and Dallas PD,
		I saw how tough police work really is - and how outdated their tools can
		be. I remember one officer in Bothell PD manually typing every license
		plate into his MDT to check for hotlists - a task that we could help
		automate in seconds with <a
			href="https://my.axon.com/s/article/FAQs-ALPR?language=en_US"
			>Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)</a
		>. That's what drives me: using tech to make critical work safer and
		smarter.
	</p>

	<h2>Beyond Work</h2>

	<p>
		Outside of work, I’m first and foremost a dad. My two kids are my world
		and my daily reminder that leadership is mostly patience, empathy and
		letting people figure things out (with supervision and snacks).
	</p>

	<p>
		When I’m not chasing deadlines (or my kids), you’ll probably find me
		cycling, lifting weights at the gym, or practicing Muay Thai. I also
		hold a black belt in Taekwondo — 5 years of kicks, bruises and humility
		that taught me discipline and the power of small, consistent
		improvement.
	</p>

	<p>
		That ties closely to one of my favorite ideas: the <strong
			>1% rule</strong
		>. If we can get just 1% better every day, we'll be 37 times better over
		365 days. That's how I approach life, work, and learning - constant
		iteration, curiosity, and compound growth. I’m always chasing that next
		1%.
	</p>

	<h2>Let's Connect</h2>

	<p>
		So that’s me — from a kid tinkering on an 80386 in Vietnam to building
		products that power tens of thousands of police agencies worldwide, I’ve
		learned that technology changes lives when built with empathy,
		curiosity, and stubborn optimism.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you’re building something meaningful — something that empowers
		people, connects communities, or just makes life a little better — I’d
		love to hear from you.
	</p>

	<p>
		👉 Drop me a note or find me on <a
			href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thucldnguyen/">LinkedIn</a
		>. I’m always up for a good conversation about product, tech, or how to
		make the world 1% better.
